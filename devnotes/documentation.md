This is a documentation text document
you really thought i would explain 500 lines of text to you huh???
ermmm yes i will

so heres a tutorial for you how to use this 

**STRUCT**

a *statically* typed language made by me :O (lol bro used chatGPT to make this lang ahah)
its main thing being constructs and keys/values

## Ok im done with the introduction here uhh
### Lets get into the good stuff
#### The only reason im using markdown is for that sweet sweet styling

**CONSTRUCTS**
Constructs are arrays that hold values such as -> strings, numbers, booleans and even arithmetic expressions!

*How to make a construct*

construct <foo> => [
Values/Keys go here... >all assigned values must end with a semicolon -> ;
]

*Reminder: This is a flat language, not nested*

**PRINTING**
Printing is quite essential since you can see the actual output of your Struct code

*How to print*

println <construct>;

*Reminder: Those angle brackets in the templates should not be written in the real code.*

**LIBRARIES**
Libraries are what make programming languages powerful; essentially what "fuels" programming languages

*What libraries are there?*

>The libraries are featured either in the hidden TODO in devnotes\ or here

- textprocessor >For text processing
- numeric >Advanced numeric processes
- utils >Utilities for struct
- array >Array manipulation

#### Some libraries shown down this heading can be dangerous!!

- net > Web interaction
- fs > File interaction
- sys >For system-level operations
- reg >Allows for registry editing

*Reminder: These are Struct's standard libraries(slib)*
