Make sure to put the shim "struct.cmd" from shm\ to PATH!

so how to put it into PATH?

win+S (Search)
type in environment variables
and click "Edit the system environment variables"
go to advanced > Environment Variables...

at system variables,find PATH (or Path)

and click path
and than edit
now make an environment variable by clicking the field that contains those paths
and put "C:\Users\TemplateName\TemplateStructInstallPath\shm\struct.cmd"
put the actual path instead of this.

than test by typing "struct" in CMD or pshell (git bash cannot recognize the shim"
